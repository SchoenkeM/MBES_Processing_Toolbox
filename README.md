# MBES Processing Toolbox
Processing Tool for hydroacoustic data recorded by multibeam echosounder (MBES) systems to classify anthropogenically impacted seafloor surface by bottom trawling, whose characteristics differ significantly from geologic morphologies. The advantage is that the statistic of the measured bathymetry is computed before the actual grid is performed.

## Installation
### Download the latest release
1. Visit the [latest release](https://github.com/SchoenkeM/MBES_Processing_Toolbox/releases/latest/).
2. Download the `Source code (zip)` file.

### Maintain as a git submodule
#### Install submodule
1. To add the MBES Processing Toolbox repository as a git submodule run:
```
git submodule add https://github.com/SchoenkeM/MBES_Processing_Toolbox.git <relativePathWithinSuperrepository>
```
This should create a `.gitmodules` file in the root of the superrepository, if it doesn't exist yet.
2. In that file add the `branch = release` line. So that it looks like this:
```
[submodule "<relativePathWithinSuperrepository>"]
	path = <relativePathWithinSuperrepository>
	url = https://github.com/SchoenkeM/MBES_Processing_Toolbox.git
	branch = release
```

#### Update submodule
1. If you want to pull the latest release from this repository to your submodule run
```
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
